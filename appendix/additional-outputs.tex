\section{Additional Software Outputs and Functionality}\label{sec:additional-outputs}


The \texttt{GLaRe()} function returns a heatmap to display the full distribution of generalization errors (Figure \ref{fig:eye-heatmap}).
It is obtained by re-ordering the $N$ values within each column of the matrix of cross-validated information losses.
The latent feature dimension is represented on the $x$-axis, the corresponding quantile of the generalization error distribution at that feature dimension (i.e., column) is shown on the $y$-axis and the color represents the value of the generalization error at that feature dimension and quantile.

The \pkg{GLaRe} package also contains wrapper functions that plot alternative summaries of the cross-validated distribution of information losses; their outputs are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:additional-plots-01}.
The function \texttt{distribution\_plot()} produces a dot-plot of the individual cross-validated information loss distribution, where each point represents an individual value and the points are colored according to the latent feature dimension $K$ (Figure \ref{fig:additional-plots-01} \textbf{(a)}).

    \caption{Additional wrapper functions that produce summary plots of \texttt{GLaRe()} outputs. \textbf{(a)} \texttt{distribution\_plot()} produces a dot-plot of the individual cross-validated information loss distribution. \textbf{(b)} \texttt{plot\_train\_validation\_ratio()} produces a point and line plot of the ratio of the total training and validation losses.
    Both plots are demonstrated on the Glaucoma dataset with a PCA representation from Section \ref{sec:software}.}

When the qualifying criterion is met, the CoLLaRe framework re-trains the final model on the full dataset at the qualifying dimension.
The \pkg{GLaRe} package contains functions to visually inspect the reconstruction of individual observations from the final model.
Due to the non-standard structure of the Glaucoma, Proteomic Gels and MNIST data, we have written custom functions to display side-by-side plots of the data observation and its reconstruction (Figures \ref{fig:eye-reconstruction} -- \ref{fig:mnist-reconstruction}).
For data objects which are $1$-dimensional signals, we provide a general function called \texttt{plot\_1D\_reconstruction()} that displays the original signal as a solid line and overlays its reconstruction as a dotted line (Figure \ref{fig:phoneme-reconstruction}).
Unlike the specialized functions that plot side-by-side plots, this function can display the reconstruction of more than one observation simultaneously.
