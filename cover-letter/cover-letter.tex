\opening{{Dear #2,}}

Please find enclosed our manuscript  \textbf{``CLaRe: Compact (near-)Lossless Latent Representations of High-Dimensional Object Data''} which we are submitting for consideration for publication as an original research article in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics.

This work introduces CLaRe, a framework for evaluating and selecting latent feature representation methods based on quantile-based generalization error control rather than traditional aggregated metrics. 
The approach enables the selection of compact, near-lossless representations of high-dimensional datasets that retain essential information for statistical modeling.

We believe that our manuscript aligns well with JCGSâ€™s focus on computational methods for data analysis and data visualization.
From a computational perspective, we propose a systematic evaluation framework using cross-validation and quantile-based loss metrics to assess latent feature representation methods.
The framework is method-agnostic, meaning that it can be used to select an optimal method in applied data analysis settings.
We also place an emphasis on visualization and graphical display -- our software implementation, an open-source \proglang{R} package called GLaRe, provides graphical summaries that aid analysis and the selection of an optimal latent feature representation.
In summary, we believe that our manuscript will be of interest to the JCGS readership because it introduces a flexible computational framework for assessing latent feature representation methods and has broad applicability, e.g., to functional data, images, and omics data.

The work has not been published or submitted for consideration for publication elsewhere and all authors have approved the final version.
Furthermore, the code to reproduce the manuscript is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/edwardgunning/MANUSCRIPT-CLaRe}.

Thank you for your consideration of our work.

\closing{Yours sincerely,
}
