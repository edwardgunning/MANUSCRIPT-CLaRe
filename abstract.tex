% Advances in modern data collection technologies have led to a proliferation of complex, structured and high-dimensional objects, such as images and curves, for data analysis.
% A common first step in statistical modelling is to learn a latent feature representation of these objects, i.e., a transformation to a lower-dimensional Euclidean space of latent features.

% {\color{red} add downsides of current work?}

% In this work, we present \pkg{GLaRe}, a software tool that can be used to assess the performance of different latent feature representation methods.
% \pkg{GLaRe} computes cross-validated measure of information loss for a latent feature representation, produces graphics to summarise the full distribution of information losses, and can be used to choose between different methods on a given dataset.
% We demonstrate the use of \pkg{GLaRe} on three motivating datasets, where we use it to choose between an principal components analysis, an autoencoder and the discrete wavelet transform.
% The three case studies demonstrate that different representations are most suitable for different datasets and hence the utility of \pkg{GLaRe} for finding an optimal representation for a given dataset.
% \pkg{GLaRe} is available as a \proglang{R} package and can be downloaded at \url{https://github.com/edwardgunning/GLaRe}.
